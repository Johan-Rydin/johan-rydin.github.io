  <h1>The Structural Necessity of Prices and Money</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Johan Rydin</p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
   I argue that prices and money are not optional institutions or equilibrium artifacts, but structurally necessary coordination mechanisms in decentralized exchange systems characterized by agent heterogeneity, informational complexity, and temporal constraints. When the informational complexity and resolution of agents exceed those of goods, and when exchange occurs on timescales faster than complete information propagation, direct coordination through communication or negotiation becomes infeasible. Under these conditions, any viable exchange system must rely on low-dimensional, rapidly updating signals that compress dispersed information. I show that prices necessarily arise as such signals, and that money further reduces coordination costs by linearizing exchange relations and decoupling trade across counterparties and time. Prices and money thus function as structural interfaces that make decentralized exchange possible under fundamental information and time constraints, independent of equilibrium optimality or rationality assumptions.
